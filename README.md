# whatsapp-gpt
to replicate my setup
* You'll need to get a new simcard and add it to WhatsApp on a phone
* log in via the qr code in the terminal after running `go run main.go`.
* `python server.py` will start a seperate browser with chatgpt.
* now add the new phone number to your contacts

Now you can chat with chatGPT for whatsapp directly or add it to a groupchat.
To trigger a respons mention it in your message like "@GPTBOT what is the best time to visit the dom tower in utrecht"
